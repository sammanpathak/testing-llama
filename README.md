This is a Streamlit hosted app for testing the LLaMa 2 7B model which is an open source large language model (LLM) developed by Meta.
This is taken from a streamlit blog tutorial for creating a LLaMa 2 chatbot ðŸ¦™ðŸ’¬. 
This is only a test version and after sometime, it will not respond as it is of free version as of now.
